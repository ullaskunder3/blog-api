# Automating My MDX Blog Workflow with a Simple Node.js Script

I maintain a **private MDX blog repo** that I sometimes push updates from. My portfolio website displays these posts as a blog page.

But over time, a few small annoyances piled up:

- Every time I write a new post, I have to **manually create the `.mdx` file** with a proper filename like `sorting-p5-visualization.mdx`.
- I need to **check the last post’s ID** to assign the next one correctly.
- I have to manually add **frontmatter** (ID, date, title, tags) every time.

It wasn’t a huge problem, but it **felt repetitive and slow**.

So, I decided to automate it.

## The Automation Script

With a simple Node.js script, I can now:

- Generate a **new post boilerplate** with just **one command**.
- Provide a **title** (required) and **optional tags**.
- Automatically update the **next ID** and **current date**.
- Check the **last post info**, including file path.
- Search for any post **by ID**.

commands:

```bash
# Create a new post with tags
pnpm new "Print all zero sum subarray" --tag "algorithm,arrays,dsa,python,hashmap,interview"

# Check last post
pnpm last

# Get info about a post by ID
pnpm post --id 19
```

The script takes care of creating the `.mdx` file, adding frontmatter, and maintaining IDs. No more copying boilerplate or double-checking filenames.

## Why This Feels “Pretty Cool”

- **One-liner creation:** I can generate a full post skeleton in seconds.
- **Safe ID management:** Never worry about duplicate IDs.
- **Optional tags:** Helps keep posts organized without extra typing.
- **Quick info retrieval:** Last post or specific ID info is just a command away.

For a private or small MDX-based blog, this is a simple but **huge productivity boost**.
